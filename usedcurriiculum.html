We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information including using standard security protocols and transmitting information securely via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and only use recognized online secure payment systems and reputable third-party payment processors and applications. Since email is not considered secure, please do not send us private information via email. Doing so is completely at your own risk. To protect our Site, we use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or hack or otherwise damage our Site. While we take these steps to protect your personal information as much as we can, no system or transmission of data over the internet or any other public network or any storage of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you are concerned about your personal information, please contact us at wcchsc2018@gmail.com.<br><br>

            In the unlikely event customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the event. We will also report such incidents to any required data protection authority. We will work closely with any customers affected to determine the next steps such as any end-user notifications, needed patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.<br><br>
